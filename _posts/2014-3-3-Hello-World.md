title: My Thoughts on React Native

I was first introducted to mobile development in a class at Boston College (BC). It was called Intro to Programming with Swift for iOS development. I absolutly loved how straighforward the class was. It met once a week and for homework we would have to build a full app every 2 - 3 weeks. We would only talk about programming contents, nothing about data structures or abstract math unless it directly applied to what we were building.

I think I loved this class so much because I hated my Computer Science 2 (CS2) class equally as much. In CS2 at BC, we only went over Data Structures that were borderline completly useless (I'm looking at you red-black trees) and were expected to learn Java, a very difficult, boilerplate heavy language, completly on our own.

After I finished iOS development, I continued to work on smaller projects outside of class and even published a few apps on the app store. One of these apps, gained a decent following, garnering over 500 downloads and about 50 daily users. I talked about tweaks to the app a lot with my friends and lot of my friends found it useful. A problem I discovered was that about 1/3 of my friends have Android devices and, alas, complained that they had no app. Determined to always please my users, I pledged to make an Android counterpart over break. 

I had worked with React over the summer at my internship and although I didn't hate it, I didn't love it either. I also knew that I had despised Java so I didn't want to make an Android app in the native language either. After two weeks of vacation, I hunkered down in my room, determined to will this Android app into existense.
