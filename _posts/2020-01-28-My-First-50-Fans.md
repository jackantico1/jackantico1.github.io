Like many aspiring entrepreneurs, I like to read a lot of self-help books. Wethers it be biographies, how-to’s, or memoirs, I love them all. Call it a guilty-habit, but they make me feel like I am improving myself a little bit without really doing that much. One of my favorite authors, Tim Ferriss, did an interview with Kevin Kelly, a co-founder of WIRED, where they talked about the concept of 1000 true fans. To paraphrase, Kelly spoke about how to be a successful creator you don’t need a million clients, customers, or fans. You only need 1000 true fans, fans that love your work and will buy or use anything that you make, to make a living as a creator. Kelly then goes into the math behind this, which you can read more about here.
