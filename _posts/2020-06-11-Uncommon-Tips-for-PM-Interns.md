I’ve interned in Product Management before (@Intralinks) and am doing it again this summer (@Shipt). Here are some things I’ve learned the second time around.

**1. Don't care about the Tech stack.** Even if you return to the company you interned with, the tech stack will likely have changed by the time you get back or you'll be working on a completely different project with a different tech stack.

**2. Understand Leading vs. Lagging Metrics.** Most interns really only get one big project they work on per summer. It's important to work on something where the success metrics are leading metrics (you can see the results after two weeks) and not lagging metrics (you can see the results after two months). You'll want to able to talk about the success of your test or what you learned at your end of the internship presentation, not say "Lmk what happens in two months" to your boss on your last day.

**3. Don't micromanage your scrum team.** Writing and assigning tickets is the job of the engineering manager/team. Describe what you want from the customers perspective and let the engineers figure out which elements and components they need to play with. Don't get stuck in the weeds, it just slows everyone down.
